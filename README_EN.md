> Alternative implementation of integration service for testing. Open-source solution for emulating 1C integration services in local development and testing environment.

## üéØ Purpose

This project provides a local environment for emulating 1C integration service APIs. The solution allows developers to test and create integration solutions for 1C without the need to access the production "1C-Bus" system.

### üß© Complete toolkit: Mock-service + 1C Extension

For end-to-end testing, the project includes an extension for 1C:Enterprise. This allows you to quickly deploy a test environment, configure 1C integration service parameters (application, process, channels) and test the transport layer of integration.

#### **Solution Components:**

*   **Mock-service:** Integration service that emulates external 1C service
*   **Web interface:** Configuration management, testing and monitoring
*   **1C Extension:** Extension for 1C:Enterprise
*   **Functionality:** Forms and methods for testing data sending and receiving
*   **Advantage:** Debug integration logic in development environment without affecting production systems

#### **Technologies:**
**Node.js (Backend) + React (Frontend) + Apache ActiveMQ Artemis (Message Broker)**

> **Technical details:** Detailed information about architecture and implementation technologies is available in the [System Architecture](docs/SystemArchitecture.md) section.

> The extension source code is located in the `[1cServIntTestExt\src]` directory.

**Key capabilities:**
- ‚úÖ **Local development** - Integration environment on local machine

## ‚öôÔ∏è Typical workflow for the provided test application

### Test application setup and configuration verification 
1.  **Environment startup**: After running `docker-compose up -d`, open **Frontend Mock Bus** at `http://localhost:3090`.

    ![Frontend Mock Bus](docs/images/0a1b2c3d-4e5f-6789-abcd-ef0123456789.png)
2.  **Test configuration generation**: Go to **Applications** page and click the `Create test application` button to generate a test suite.
3.  **Test application creation**: The system will create a test application, processes and channels, register them in the database and create users and queues in Artemis.

    ![Test application creation](docs/images/1b2c3d4e-5f6a-789b-cdef-012345678abc.png)

    **Specific test application values:**
    - **Application**: `testAppE2e` with description "Test application for E2E testing". Use as username when configuring integration service in 1C.
    - **ClientSecret**: automatically generated as 16-byte hex token (32 characters, e.g., `68bdf9565056a16f21615505c3cae5a6`)
    - **id_token**: automatically generated as 32-byte base64 token. E.g., `B0fKm9xmQNXZxkBOhkKCYndP2Ng0rV2Y29OYa76lEFUz`
    - **Process**: `e1c::TestProject::Main::OfficeToShop` (mimics 1C structure)
    - **Channels**: 
        - Outbound: `e2eOutOfficeToOffice` with destination `OfficeToOffice` (type `outbound`) ‚Äî for sending messages to queue that will be automatically processed by consumer
        - Outbound: `e2eOutOfficeToShop` with destination `OfficeToShop` (type `outbound`) ‚Äî for sending messages to queue without automatic consumption (for viewing in Artemis console)
        - Inbound: `e2eInOfficeToOffice` with destination `OfficeToOffice` (type `inbound`) ‚Äî for receiving messages from OfficeToOffice queue
  
   **The following operations are performed automatically:**
      - Creating user in Artemis with username and password equal to `id_token`
      - Creating addresses `OfficeToOffice` and `OfficeToShop` with routing type `ANYCAST` (point-to-point)
      - Creating queues `OfficeToOffice` and `OfficeToShop` in corresponding addresses (durable=true)
      - Registration in MongoDB with full hierarchy: Application ‚Üí Process ‚Üí Channels
4.  **API connection check**: Use **API Check** page to simulate requests from 1C. Get channel metadata and runtime configuration to verify mock service settings.

    ![API connection check](docs/images/2c3d4e5f-6a7b-89cd-ef01-23456789abcd.png)

5.  **Test message sending**: Go to **Channel Testing** page, select test application, select channel, the queue corresponding to the channel in ActiveMQ message broker will be displayed. Fill in message text, perform sending to broker.

    ![Test message sending](docs/images/3d4e5f6a-7b8c-9def-0123-456789abcdef.png)

6.  **Verification and receiving**: Open **Artemis web console** (`http://localhost:8161`), check message delivery to queue (Queues tab). Return to **Channel Testing** and click "Get last message" to read from queue. You should see the message text that you previously sent to the queue. At the same time, the broker console will display message delivery information in the queue.

### Verification using 1C extension
1.  **Extension installation**: Install extension for 1C:Enterprise.
2.  **Test service setup**: 

**Option 1:**
In Enterprise mode, configure integration service through "Integration Service Management" processing. Use `Application Name` as username, `ClientSecret` as password and URLs from frontend. After setup, you can test sending and receiving messages using the extension.
![Integration service parameters](docs/images/4e5f6a7b-8c9d-0ef1-2345-6789abcdef01.png)

**Option 2:**
Open "Service Testing" processing from extension (section "Service Integration (Mock)")
- The "Parameters" tab will display default parameters corresponding to our test environment. If necessary, you can change URL, logs and password for connecting to integration service backend.

   ![Integration service parameters](docs/images/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890.png)
- On "Test Service Setup" tab, first click "Create test application (in Mock-service)" button
- Then click "Configure integration service (in 1C)" button

   ![Test service setup](docs/images/b2c3d4e5-f6a7-8901-bcde-f23456789012.png)

3.  **Message sending**: Open "Service Testing" processing from extension (section "Service Integration (Mock)"). On "Message Sending" tab, specify the number of messages to send, specify integration service "TMS_mockService" and channel e2eOfficeToOffice and click "Send messages (save to IntegChannelOutQueue queue)" button. At this moment, messages will be saved to the outgoing message queue in the 1C application database (OutboxTable pattern implementation).

   ![Message sending](docs/images/d4e5f6a7-b8c9-1234-def0-456789abcdef.png)

Note: you can check using PAPI extension and "Integration Service Messages" processing. Extension package link: https://github.com/dsdred/PAPI

4.  **Running technical scheduled jobs**: Set "Check message receiving" flag. Execute "Run processing" command. At this moment, three technical background jobs managed by 1C platform will be started. Messages from internal IntegChannelOutQueue table with previously generated messages will be sent to Artemis message broker.
To control the correctness of integration flow operation, you can go to Artemis console and check the following entities:
- Connections: you should see two connections corresponding to two background jobs (inbound and outbound message queue processing)

   ![Connections in Artemis console](docs/images/f6a7b8c9-d0e1-3456-f012-6789abcdef01.png)

- Sessions: also two sessions with different identifiers (similar to Connections)

   ![Sessions in Artemis console](docs/images/a7b8c9d0-e1f2-4567-0123-789abcdef012.png)
- Producers: you should see one line with producer corresponding to background job that handles message sending to queue

   ![Producers in Artemis console](docs/images/b4c5d6e7-f8a9-bcde-789a-ef0123456789.png)
- Consumers: you should see one line with consumer corresponding to background job that handles message receiving from queue

   ![Consumers in Artemis console](docs/images/b8c9d0e1-f2a3-5678-1234-89abcdef0123.png)
- Queues: you should see OfficeToOffice and OfficeToShop queues. According to test application configuration, these queues are used for various testing scenarios

   ![Queues in Artemis console](docs/images/c9d0e1f2-a3b4-6789-2345-9abcdef01234.png)
- Browse Messages: you can view messages in queue if they haven't been received by consumer yet

   ![Browse Messages - message viewing](docs/images/d0e1f2a3-b4c5-789a-3456-abcdef012345.png)

   Message list in OfficeToShop queue

   ![Messages in OfficeToShop queue](docs/images/e1f2a3b4-c5d6-89ab-4567-bcdef0123456.png)

   You can also view message content in OfficeToOffice queue

   ![Message content in OfficeToOffice queue](docs/images/f2a3b4c5-d6e7-9abc-5678-cdef01234567.png)

   ![Message details](docs/images/a3b4c5d6-e7f8-abcd-6789-def012345678.png)

5.  **Message receiving verification**: Since technical background jobs run in parallel, immediately after sending messages from queue in Artemis message broker, they will be received into technical inbound message queue table IntegChannelInQueue, after successful saving, 1C platform will notify broker about successful message reception.
   During message sending from 1C, we start waiting handler (if "Check message receiving" checkbox is set), which controls message reception from queue and their recording into auxiliary "Incoming Messages" information register, notifies us about receiving all messages from message group and displays statistics on sending and receiving messages.

   Open "Incoming Messages" information register and make sure messages were received.

   Open queue list in Queues section and make sure that messages in OfficeToOffice queue were received by consumer: `Total Messages Added` field values equal `Total Messages Acked`. Messages in OfficeToShop queue will remain for viewing in console

6.  **Connection lifetime verification during background job operation**: After 2 minutes, if you didn't click "Run processing" button again, connections to Artemis message broker should be closed.
You can click "Run processing" button after a minute and make sure connections to Artemis message broker are open.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Application setup for existing integration service in 1C application and testing

Open "Service Testing" processing from extension (section "Service Integration (Mock)"). On "Application Setup" tab, select existing integration service in your 1C application that you want to test.
Specify application name in mock service that corresponds to integration service in 1C. By default, test application `MyApplication` will be used.
Click "Create and configure by metadata" button and system will automatically create applications, processes and channels in mock service.

![Application setup](docs/images/c3d4e5f6-a7b8-9012-cdef-345678901234.png)

Created application parameters can be checked and corrected if necessary (queue names) in mock service frontend at `http://localhost:3090/`.
After that, you can test message sending to this service on "Message Sending" tab.

Note - in this case, separate channels are created for sending and receiving messages according to integration service metadata in 1C.
By default, only message sending to integration service will be available, as queue names for inbound and outbound channels will not match.
After sending, you can use `scripts/office-to-shop-consumer.js` script to check message reception from OfficeToShop queue. For this, you need to copy the script and change queue name in script as it will be named in created application and run it.
